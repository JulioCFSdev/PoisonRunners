# PoisonRunners

Zombie Poison Runner is an infinite runner game created for a 72-hour game jam with the theme of poison. In this game, you control a zombie who has been poisoned and needs to eat as many brains as possible to survive. The game takes place on a never-ending road where the player must avoid obstacles and collect potions to keep the poison at bay.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to eat as many brains as possible and collect potions while avoiding obstacles. The zombie will run forward automatically, and the player must jump, slide, and dodge to avoid obstacles. If the player hits an obstacle or fails to collect enough potions, the poison will overtake the zombie, and the game will end.
